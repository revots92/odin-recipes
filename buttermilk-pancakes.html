      <h3>Buttermilk Pancakes Example</h3>
        <p>Light and fluffy pancakes with a buttermilk kick.</p>
        <p>Perfect for breakfast in bed, with a compote.</p>
         <header>Ingredients</header>
          <ul>
            <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons white sugar</li>
            <li>3 teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>1<sub>1/2</sub> teaspoons baking soda</li>
            <li><sub>3/4</sub> teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>3 cups buttermilk</li>
            <li><sub>1/2</sub> cup milk</li>
            <li>3 eggs</li>
            <li><sub>1/3</sub> cup butter,melted</li>
          </ul>
          <br>
          <ol>
            <li>Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl. Beat together buttermilk, milk, eggs, and melted butter in a separate bowl. Keep the two mixtures separate until you are ready to cook</li>
            <li>heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium-high heat. You can flick water across the surface and if it beads up and sizzles, it's ready.</li>
            <li>pour the wet mixture into the dry mixture; use a wooden spoon or fork to mix until it's just blended together. The batter will be a little lump which is what you want.</li>
            <li>Pour or scoop the batter onto the preheated griddle, using appoximately 1/2 cup for each pancake. Cook until bubbles appear on the surface, 1 to 2 minutes; flip with a spatula and cook until browned on the other side. Repeat with remaining batter.</li>
            <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
